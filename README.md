# SwerveDriveBase
Base code for our first swerve drive base, developed during Summer 2023 and used for the first time for the 2023 BunnyBots competition.

## Robot Info
- Designed for the **SDS MK4i** swerve module in the **L3** gear configuration.
- **Falcon 500s** for driving.
- **Rev NEOs** for turning.
- **CANCoders** as absolute encoders
- _Be sure to check out [SwerveDriveConstants](src/main/java/frc/robot/constants/SwerveDriveConstants.java) and change the configurations as needed!_
